learn-specflow
==============

A simple .NET web application and tests to help teaching Specflow (Gherkin), NUnit, Coypu

** You will need Visual Studio Professional (2012 or later) for this tutorial. There is a work-around using the Express Versions (see https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Visual-Studio-Express-Integration) but, due to time constraints in this live coding presentation, we wonÂ´t be following that path.

Before we begin
=====
  * Install Visual Studio 2012 or later
  * Go to Tools -> Online and type "Specflow" in the search box. Select the package and click on "Download". This will install the Specflow extension to your VS
 
Setup
=====
  1. Create a new Class Library project/solution for the tests. 
  2. Using the package manager, install the following packages:
    * Specflow.NUnit
    * Coypu
